# DSAA-Stack
* DSAA = Data Structures and Algorithms 

## Introduction 
* As a data structures and algorithms fan, I wanted to create a lesson series for people who are trying to pass Data structres and Algorithms courses. The video explanations are at my superpeer. 

## What is included at this page and inside the codes? 
* Explanation of Stack methods. 
* Basic Explanation of Stack Methods complexity. 

## What do you explain at superpeer?
* Explaining the Stack deeply. 
* I explain how we calculate complext aglorithms complexity.
* Solving special Stack questions.
